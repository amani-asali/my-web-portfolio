                Academic Project
              </h5>
              <p class="bd-notification is-primary">
                This project investigates and analyses the possibility of turning the Cardiff
                boneyard into a fashion show venue. I opted to pursue this project as I am attracted
                to this career and subject that is fashion. It is close to my heart and modelling as
                well as participating in fashion shows is something that I used to do when I was
                younger. <br />
                <br />
                I strongly feel that there is a lack-of professional and academic
                facilities/locations to exhibit fashion in Cardiff and used this project as an
                opportunity to demonstrate and convey that the containers, land formation and
                overall boneyard can be used, designed, and transitioned into a fashion show venue
                where both professionals and students have access to learn about as well as produce
                and promote fashion shows by using the best practices available, hands-on training
                and thinking sustainably. <br />
                <br />
                Personally, I have been In multiple fashion shows, both informally and formally, I
                still have a large collection of pictures of the venues that I have been in and
                understand the functions as well as features of these venues which led me to
                investigate the feasibility of designing the boneyard to be a fashion show venue
                through my learnings of interior and architectural design; combining both fields
                that I am highly intrigued in aims of putting together a great design. Not only is
                the combination of these two sectors (fashion and interior design) something that
                excites me, but it is also something that proved to be a challenge to design in this
                age due to the excessive requirement of physical activities and close proximity of
                other people and models which could, for the foreseeable future, go against the
                COVID-19 rules regarding safety and gatherings. I have attempted to address the
                guidelines set by introducing health and safety safeguards in certain facilities
                such as the lavatory and reception. Not to mention, the audience that such lavish
                events would attract also require extensive security measures. <br />
                <br />
                All in all, the venues accessibility, function(s), features and potential issues
                have all drawn out the best of my artistic ability as well as the necessity for
                critical thinking and the project is definitely something to continuously work on,
                improve, re-iterate over both terms.
